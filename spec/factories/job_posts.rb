# To generate this factory run:

# in the factory file we have access to the column names as methods which takes a block to generate fake infos for us

    # Sequence is a method provided by factory_bot which keeps injecting a variable n. 
    # n is usually a number that factory-bot increments on every object it generates,
    #  so we can use it to make sure all the instances created re unique.

    # In this case we are adding 100 character to the description of any job_post to make sure it passes a description validation.

# FactoryBot.create(:job_post)  üëàüèªSo this will create a object and save it in a database
# Factory.build(:job_post) üëàüèª So this wi0ll give us an object like .new but will not save in database 
# FactoryBot.attributes_for(:job_post)
# Returns a plain hash of the parameters required to create
# a JobPost

# FactoryBot.build(:job_post)
# Returns a new un-saved instance of JobPost
# (using the factory)

# We can also overwrite the FactoryBot
# job_post_a = FactoryBot.create(
#   :job_post, title: "Software Engineer"
