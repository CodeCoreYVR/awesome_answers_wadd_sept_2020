<%#
  To create a form for a resource (i.e. a model), use
  the form_with helper instead of formm_tag. Its usual
  arguments are:
  - A named argument 'model' which is assigned an
  instance of a model. This question will be a new question 
  from the new action or an existing question from the edit 
  action. The form_with tag checks to see if the instance is persisted,
  and if it is, then it makes a PATCH, if it's not, it makes a POST.
  - A named argument 'local', which will prevent
  the form from submitting its data using AJAX.
  - A block that is passed the form object, where
   we build the HTML inside the form (i.e. labels,
   inputs, submission buttons, etc.)
   All data from the input fields a form built with this will have its name-value nested in a hash named
   after the class of the passed in model
   (e.g. <input type="text" name="question[title]" id="question_title"> => { "question": { "title": "What?"} })

    <%= form.label :title %>
    <%= form.text_field :title %>

  <div>
    <%= form.label :body %>
    <%= form.text_area :body %>
  </div>

  <%= form.submit %>
